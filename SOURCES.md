# Documenation and Sources for Configuration
For links to various sources related to configuration settings in the dotfiles.

## Usage
Sources are stored below in a randomly ordered list.

To add a source:
    1. Append a line to the ordered list in `Sources`.
    2. Add URL of source to the new list item.
    3. Add a comment to the dotfile
    4. Add a reference to line item number to the end of the comment:
        - ex. `[1]`

## Sources
Sources are randomly ordered. This little bit of chaos, preserves the integrity
of dotfile references to each URL below. Remember to always append new line items.
Never prepend or insert.
